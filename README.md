## Step 3: Get credentials

- Create a new space inside your Contentful account

## Step 4: Install the Contentful CLI

Using homebrew:

```bash
brew install contentful-cli
```

Using npm:

```bash
npm install -g contentful-cli
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn global add contentful-cli

```

## Step 5: Authenticate with the CLI

Run `contentful login` in your terminal and follow the instructions in your browser.

___

## Step 6: Run the import

Import the content model and example post to your Contentful space.

[Access the Contentful CLI docs on importing/exporting data here.](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/cli/import-and-export/)

### ::TLDR

Run the following command in your terminal, ensuring you switch out SPACE_ID for your new Space ID.

```bash
cd /path/to/repo/thingoftheday/setup

contentful space import --space-id SPACE_ID --content-file contentful-export.json
```

The terminal will do some fancy things. If all looks good - refresh Contentful in your browser and you'll find the content model and example post has been imported for you! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Step 7: Run the application

thingoftheday uses no frameworks and is powered by vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

To be able to serve the JS module to the browser, you'll need to serve the files over a local http server.

[You can do this really nicely with this http-server package.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

Install http-server globally, and start the development server locally by running:

```bash
cd path/to/repo
npx http-server
```

## And you're done

With your http server started, your credentials file configured, and your content model imported, you'll be able to visit your very own thingoftheday microblog in your browser - all within minutes.

And remember:
