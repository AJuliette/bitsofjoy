## Getting started

This repo uses no frameworks and is powered by vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

You'll need to start a local server to be able to serve the JS module to the browser.

[You can do this really nicely with http-server.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

For example, to start the development server, run:

```bash
cd path/to/repo
npx http-server
```
